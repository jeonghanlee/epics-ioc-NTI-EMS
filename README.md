# Modbus EPICS IOC for NTI E1W

**This repository is only for an example, we decided not to use this product due to unknown Modbus connection stabilities. I didn't catch up their latest firmware also.**

If one needs many temperature monitoring channels, I recommend to check the Measurement Computing TC-32 unit.


NTI E1W [1] is the low-cost environment monitoring system with 1-wire temperature over Modbus TCP/IP. The NTI E1W also supports the SNMP, but I don't test it yet.

It supports 24 single reading 1-wire sensors in any combination, but this example only has 8 temperature sensors.



## Requirements

* EPICS BASE
* Asyn R4-40
* Latest EPICS modbus 54cea0d (Probably R3-1) : The version of Modbus should support `FLOAT32_LE_BS` [2].

## Firmware

Firmware revision should be larger than 3.2, because from the firmware 3.2, E1W supports MODBUS protocol. The firmware 3.3 or latest one is recommended.

## Build

With the standard EPICS building system, please run `make`

## Run

```bash
./cmds/E1W.cmd
```

## Check PVs

```bash
 $ bash scripts/caget_pvs.bash -l LBNL_OneWireIOC_PVs.list

>> Selected PV and its value with caget
